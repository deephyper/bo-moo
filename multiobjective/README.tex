DeepHyper handles problems with more than one objective (multiobjective
optimization problems) by using a scalarization function to reduce the
problem to a single objective. By utilizing one or more scalarizations,
DeepHyper can produce numerous Pareto optimal solutions in parallel without
significant modification to its scalable Bayesian optimization framework.
In general, if $F(x)$ is a multiobjective function, then each of DeepHyper's
scalarizations solves the problem
$$
\min_x G(F(x))
$$
where $G : \mathbb{R}^o \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

Currently, the available options for the scalarization function $G$ include
five common methods from the multiobjective literature, specifically,
the weighted-sum method (Linear), weighted quadratic-sum method (Quadratic),
weighted Chebyshev (Chebyshev), weighted augmented Chebyshev (AugChebyshev),
and penalty boundary intersection (PBI).

Let $w \geq 0$ be a vector of weights in $\mathbb{R}^o$, let $z$ be a utopia
point, and let $W$ be a positive-definite matrix. Then the linear
scalarization is given by
$$
G_{L}(F; w) = w^\top (-F);
$$
the quadratic scalarization is given by
$$
G_{Q}(F; W, z) = |F - z|^\top W |F - z|;
$$
the Chebyshev scalarization is given by
$$
G_{C}(F; w, z) = \max_{i=1,\ldots,o} w_i|F_i - z_i|;
$$
the AugChebyshev scalarization is given by
$$
G_{A}(F; w, z) = (\max_{i=1,\ldots,o} w_i|F_i - z_i|)
                 + \alpha\sum_{i=1}^o|F_i - z_i|;
$$
and the PBI scalarization is given by
$$
G_{P}(F; w, z) = d_1(z - F; w) + \theta d_2(z - F; w)
$$
where $d_1(y; w) = |y^\top w / \|w\||$ and
$d_2(y; w) = \|y - d_1 w / \|w\|\|$.

Each of the above methods can be used with a fixed $w$/$W$ in cases where a
domain-specific weighting is known a priori, or different weightings can be
provided to each worker to achieve Pareto front coverage. Alternatively,
DeepHyper can uniformly sample all new scalarization weights in each iteration
in order to heuristically achieve uniform coverage of the Pareto front.
